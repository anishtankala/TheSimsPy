# memories

## the lab

your memories of those long yeras are blurry.

full of pain, full of fear. but also of hatred, for the man in the white coat who rguarly bent over you, to inject all sorts of products into your veins, and to engrave with a scalpel burning glyphs on your skin.

the other scientists called him "the professor".

the hope of revenge is all that keeps you going today.

## cartomancy

the old fortune teller remained for a long time contemplating her cards.

## journey

that journey you took in your youth brought you to distant lands, full of ancient and forgotten magic, rich in dark and dangerous forces.
